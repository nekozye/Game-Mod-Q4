Turret Engineer Mod


This mod includes

-map to use the turrets on, with sample monster (no AI at the moment, no spawning at the moment.)
-5 modded weapons that spawns turret instead of shoots
-5 turret that spawns, upgradable by shooting with the weapons that spawned
-new value called scrap, that is used with conjunction to spawn and upgrade turrets
-GUI element that reflects the afformentioned scrap


How to install

-copy paste content (not the actual folder) of the noncodeaddon to the Quake 4 Folder of your system.
-copy the quake 4.exe modlauncher, change the source program to actual quake in your system, and run the shortcut. (note, please don't touch the augments while changing the source program)


Demo includes

- The shortcut will run the map, where it gives out 5 guns to fire to spawn the turret. one of the tower, railgun, needs more than you have initially so you need to kill some mobs to spawn it, or use cheat "give scrap" to get more.
- kill the mob and you will get some scrap back.
- shoot the turret with same gun that you spawn to upgrade. upgrade price varies, and differs from spawn scrap.
- turret only spawns on top of the platform.
